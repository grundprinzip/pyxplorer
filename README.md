# pyxplorer -- Easy Interactive Data Profiling for Big Data (and Small Data)

The goal of pyxplorer is to provide a simple tool that allows interactive profiling of datasets that are accessible 
via a SQL like interface.

I built this piece of software while trying to get a better understanding of data distribution in a massive several 
hundred million record large dataset.

## Usage



## Dependencies

  * pandas
  * phys2 for Hive based loading of data sets
